# Modified project files from spaCy tutorial
These files will be used to modify the [ner_drugs tutorial](https://github.com/explosion/projects/tree/v3/tutorials/ner_drugs) to use a transformer.  

To go follow my ODSC tutorial, you will need to follow these steps:
- run `spacy project clone tutorials/ner_drugs`
- copy `project.yml` from this directory into the spaCy tutorial's `ner_drugs` directory
- copy `config_trf.cfg` into the `ner_drugs/configs` directory
