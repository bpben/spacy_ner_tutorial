# Example models from tutorial
#### Note - this is hosted on git LFS for the ODSC tutorial, it may not be available after 4/2022.  If you want these models, please reach out and let me know (or train them yourself!)

These models are trained as part of [the notebook](https://github.com/bpben/spacy_ner_tutorial/blob/master/spacy_run_ner_drug_tutorial.ipynb) on [n2c2's 2018 challenge dataset](https://portal.dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/).  You can get free access to the data by registering and train these yourself!
