# Named-Entity Recognition pipelines with SpaCy
These materials are part of the workshop [Neural Named-Entity Recognition pipelines with spaCy](https://odsc.com/speakers/neural-named-entity-recognition-pipelines-with-spacy/) at ODSC East 2022

Slides are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Dj9ip04TslPU8TQID93toXSpYqXSl70XJShkvwlhdhM/edit?usp=sharing) (Google Slides)

`spacy_ner_tutorial_odsc_2022` - notebook from the tutoria

`ner_drugs/` - contains project and config files for modifiying spaCy's [ner drug tutorial](https://github.com/explosion/projects/tree/v3/tutorials/ner_drugs) to use transformer models

`n2c2/` - contains all the materials for training spaCy models based on the 2018 n2c2 challenge (except the data! you'll need to [register with n2c2](https://portal.dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/) to get that)

`example_models/` - contains n2c2-trained models, requires git lfs (may not be maintained after 4/2022)
